// Week 2 - Loops

// In the following exercises, you will need to place your code or answer underneath each
// exercise prompt.

// First try answering these without using references or looking up any information.
// Then, check your answer by using references and/or running your code.
// You can run your JS code using the Chrome or Firefox Developer tools, or by using Node.js.
// Feel free to update your answers if you got them wrong at first -- this exercise is for your own learning.
// But make sure you understand why the correct answer is right.

// Exercise 1. Write a 'while' loop that prints the integers (whole numbers)
// between 1 and 5 (inclusive).

let i = 1;
while(i <=5){
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}
console.log("\nEND OF QUESTION 1\n")

// Exercise 2. Write a 'do while' loop that prints the integers (whole numbers)
// between 1 and 5 (inclusive).
let a = 1;
do {
  console.log(a);
  a++;
} while(a<=5);

console.log("\nEND OF QUESTION 2\n")

// Exercise 3. Write a 'for' loop that prints the integers (whole numbers)
// between 1 and 5 (inclusive).

for(let b =  1; b <=5; b++ ){
  console.log(b);
}

console.log("\nEND OF QUESTION 3\n")

// Exercise 4. Now we want a loop that prints the integers
// counting DOWN from 10 to 1 (inclusive). Write three loops that do this, to practice
// writing loops in all 3 ways -- as a 'while', 'do while', and 'for' loop.

//For loop implementation
for(let c = 10; c >= 1; c--){
  console.log(c);
}

//While loop implementation
let d = 10;
while(d >=1){
  console.log(d)
  d--;

}

//Do while loop implementation
let e = 10;
do{
  console.log(e)
  e--;

}while(e>=1);

console.log("\nEND OF QUESTION 4\n")

// Exercise 5. Write a loop that prints the integers from 7 to 27. Write this
// loop in all 3 ways -- as a 'while', 'do while', and 'for' loop.

//For loop implementation
for(let f = 7; f < 27; f++){
  console.log(f);
}

//While loop implementation
let g = 7;
while(g < 27){
  console.log(g)
  g++;

}

//Do while loop implementation
let h = 7;
do{
  console.log(h)
  h++;

}while(h<27);

console.log("\nEND OF QUESTION 5\n")


// Exercise 6. Write a loop that prints numbers between 0 and 100, counting by tens.
// I.e. it will print 10, then 20, then 30, etc.
// Write this loop in all 3 ways -- as a 'while', 'do while', and 'for' loop.

//For loop implementation
for(let j = 0; j < 100; j+= 10){
  console.log(j);
}

//While loop implementation
let k = 0;
while(k < 100){
  console.log(k)
  k+=10;

}

//Do while loop implementation
let l = 0;
do{
  console.log(l)
  l+=10;

}while(l<100);

console.log("\nEND OF QUESTION 6\n")



// Exercise 7. Add a comment as to why the following loop is an infinite loop (will
// run without ever stopping). Then fix the loop so that it stops when
// counterFour is equal to -100.

//Solution: Based on the condition being evaluated the while loop will run so long as the counter is less than 2.
//
let counterFour = 1;
while (counterFour >= -100) {
    console.log('HELP ME!')
    counterFour--;
}

console.log("\nEND OF QUESTION 7\n")

// Exercise 8. Make a variable that contains your favorite integer. Write a loop
// (your choice which type) that prints the integers from 0 to that number.

for(let m = 0; m <= 25; m++){
  console.log(m);
}
console.log("\nEND OF QUESTION 8\n")

// Exercise 9. Make a variable that contains your favorite integer (this time make sure it's
// less than 100). Write a loop (your choice which type) that prints the integers from 0 to 100.
// Next to each number it should print "not my favorite number". But next to your favorite
// number it should print "my favorite number!". Example output (if your favorite number was 2):
// 0 not my favorite number
// 1 not my favorite number
// 2 my favorite number!
// 3 not my favorite number
// ...
// (Hint - use an if statement in your loop)

for(let n = 0; n < 100; n++){
  if (n === 25){
    console.log(n +" is my favorite number!");
  } else {
    console.log(n +" is not my favorite number.")
  }
}
console.log("\nEND OF QUESTION 9\n")


// Exercise 10. In some of the exercises above, we had you write all 3 types of loops, for practice.
// But in real life, how would you decide which type of loop to use? You might not have an
// exact answer, but spend a few minutes thinking about the different types of loops and/or
// doing some research and write down your thoughts in a comment below:

//For loops are good for looping through arrays and other finite properties.
//While loops are good for if you need somehting to run until a condition is met.
//Do while loops are good for the same except if you need it to run once without evaluating the condition.
console.log("\nEND OF QUESTION 10\n")


// Exercise 11. Now we'll practice using nested loops (a loop inside another loop)!
// Update the nested loops below to so that for each value of outsideCounter,
// the inside loop will show a countdown

/*
counting down from 0
***********************************
counting down from 1
inside 1
***********************************
counting down from 2
inside 2
inside 1
***********************************
counting down from 3
inside 3
inside 2
inside 1
***********************************
*/

for (let outsideCounter = 0; outsideCounter <= 3; outsideCounter++) {
  console.log("counting down from", outsideCounter);
  for (let insideCounter = outsideCounter; insideCounter > 0 ; insideCounter--) {
      console.log("inside", insideCounter);
  }
  console.log("***********************************")
}


// Congrats, you made it to the end!
// Did you find this easy or hard? If you used references, which ones helped you?
// Please answer in a comment below.
//Easy but good review! Didn't know that redeclarations of variables using let is not allowed so looked that up.
